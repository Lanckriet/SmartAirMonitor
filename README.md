# SmartAirMonitor
Welcome to the Github repository for the Smart Air Monitor, a casual IoT project.

# Contents
the contents of this repository will be as follows:

    - HTML / CSS / JS code for the progressive web app
    - sketch for the NodeMCU ESP8266 (upon completion)
    
# About
This project is mainly for fun, but also for me to learn more about both front-end web development and IoT development.
The device will use a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, along with a carbon monoxide sensor and an aerosol/dust sensor to measure the properties of the air in a room and determine its quality.

The device could be placed anywhere in a room and left to monitor the air on its own for extended period of time, to not only give real-time measurements but also make averages and analyze changes in the air quality depending on the time of day.

The Smart Air Monitor will have an LCD display for its measurements, along with a row of LED lights that will gradually light up as the dust content in the air rises, and finally a speaker which will function as an alarm in case of dangerously high carbon monoxide measurements.

All the information from the sensors will also be sent to ThingSpeak, and displayed on a web app at https://air-monitor-pwa.web.app/.

# Credits
I would like to thank the people of RandomNerdTutorials, Instructibles, Components101, the Arduino community, Reddit, the ThingSpeak community, and many more for sharing their knowledge of IoT development online for free.

I would also like to thank the lecturers at the Howest University of Applied Sciences for teaching me the basics of IoT / web development which allowed me to begin this project in the first place. More information about Howest can be found at https://www.howest.be.
